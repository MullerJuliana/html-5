                    <div style="font-size: 22px;margin: 0px 120px; font-family: Arial; text-align: left;">
                        <p>Because I enjoy learning about computers and have had some experience by building them, I am currently interested in a tech career. 
                            However I'm still not completely sure what specific field I'm gonna choose. I feel that I would like to major in front end development or software development. </p>
                        <p>I would like to work for a big company that gives opportunities for career growth, support for its employees with benefits while at the same time be able to
                             work on my own projects. I would also love to have the opportunity to travel in my job if it requires it.</p>

                <h2 style="color: rgb(108, 77, 36);margin:30px; font-size: 35px; padding: 0px 50px 0px 90px; text-align: left;">College Plans</h2>
                     <div style="font-size: 22px;margin: 0px 120px; font-family: Arial; text-align: left;">
                         <p>When it comes to the topic of college though, I am currently finding myself in a dilemma right now because of the different opportunities
                             that have recently been presented to me. On one hand I could stay here and look for a good college or university to study my career and get some 
                             financial help through scholarships and support. But my parents have also told me that It would be good for me that after graduating I worked for some 
                             time and then went back to Colombia while they stay in the US for an extra year, because the currencies are so different they would be able to pay the best universities in the country while 
                             also getting me my own apartment, and because of my english skills I will have way more opportunities of getting hired as a developer there.  </p>
                        <p>Even though im considering it, I will still apply to different colleges here and do further research to find what would be the best for my future, since I should also take how good the job opportunities are here since its the Silicon Valley, so I have a lot to think about.</p>
